<div class="warning">
    This installation method relies on a third-party service and may
    break at any time without notice. Instead, consider preinstalling a JDK on
    agents, using images that already include a JDK, or downloading the desired
    JDK manually and configuring the <q>Extract *.zip/*.tar.gz</q> installer.
